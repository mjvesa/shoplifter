An esoteric programming language.

Features
========
The language is an AOT transpiler based on RPN syntax. It can be transpiled
into a near idiomatic form of most procedural languages (including C like,
Lisp like and SSA forms). Other features:

 * Minimal transpiler (Pascal version around 300 lines)
 * Uses macros, macro file can be changed to change the target
 * Untyped, but rudimentary type checking is planned

 Purpose and goals
 =================
 Main purpose is to learn and to have fun. Check issues and examples
 for what's cooking.
