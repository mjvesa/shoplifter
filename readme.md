Features
========
The language is an AOT transpiler based on RPN syntax. It can be transpiled
into a near idiomatic form of most procedural languages (including C like,
Lisp like and SSA forms). Other features:

    * Minimal compiler (Pascal version around 300 lines)
    * Meta language for writing targets, object language for programs
    * Operationally typed, like Forth or BCPL

Purpose and goals
=================
Main purpose is to learn and to have fun. Check issues and examples
for what's cooking.
